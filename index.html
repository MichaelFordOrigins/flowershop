	<p> These flowers are often the most recognizable since they pop out the ground after a long period of bleakness, and they typically appear after the danger of frost has passed. Daffodils, which come in an astounding array of colors, bloom in the early spring. Other spring flowers include the beloved tulip, the lovely flower of mid-spring, as well as hyacinths, which add a pleasing scent to any garden.

<p> There are very few flowers that strictly grow during autumn. Most fall flowers are resilient enough for the hot heat of summer, but also the cool weather that autumn brings. Some of the most common flowers that are known to last into the late autumn are asters, carnations, gerbera daisies, and the following: 

Dahlias are a great choice for fall, because they last until the first frost. They grow best in full-sun, but are often eaten by many insects and slugs; therefore, it a good idea to plant other growth around it that might deter slugs and other insects. 



Roses are another bush that blooms until the first frost. As long as you prune them well, they will flourish throughout the season. The great thing about roses is that there are many different kinds to choose from in a multitude of colors. The bushes need a lot of maintenance the first year, but after that, annual pruning will do wonders.

	<p> When you think of winter flowers, you often think of indoor potted plants, but there are flowers that will grow outside in the winter regardless of the climate you live in. 

Snowdrop flowers are January's birth month flower and will often begin to grow at the end of winter right before spring comes. They usually precede daffodils and other summer flowers. </p>

<p>Poinsettia flowers are often thought of as a Christmas flower due to its ability to flourish during the winter months. You can keep your flowers indoors, it will live the best in cooler temperatures like 65-70 degrees. Poinsettias do not like to be watered too much nor do they like a lot of sun. Choose a place where the sun is limited, and make sure the ground is only slightly moist, but not dry. </p>
